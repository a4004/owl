Owl instances are designed to be GPL-3.0 compliant whilst allowing modifications to the original source code as provisioned by the GPL-3.0 license without the requirement of derivative works being published under the condition that clients only interact with the software over a computer network such as one hosted by Discord.

Any Owl instance provided to you or another individual or group by a third party does not guarantee it is free/libre open-source software and may contain proprietary
`blobs` "binary large objects" of which source code may not be available and may be licensed under a proprietary license.
